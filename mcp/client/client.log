Query: what is LLM short for?

LLM stands for **Large Language Model**. It refers to a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform tasks like answering questions, writing content, translating languages, and more. Examples include OpenAI's GPT models, Google's Bard, and Meta's LLaMA.

In other contexts, LLM can also stand for:
- **Master of Laws** (Latin: *Legum Magister*), a postgraduate academic degree in law.
- **Low-Level Medium**, a term used in some technical or scientific fields.

However, in the context of AI and technology, it most commonly refers to Large Language Models.
